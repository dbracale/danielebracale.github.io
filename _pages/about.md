I am a third year PhD student in Statistics at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor. My research interests broadly lie in the areas of theoretical machine learning, probability theory and frequentist statistics. I graduated from University of Turin (2016) with a BS in Mathematics, and an MS in Stochastics and Data Science (2021). Before enrolling in the PhD program, I had the opportunity to work as a tutor and research assistant at the University of Turin. 

I am very passionate about teaching, and I always strive to get better at communicating difficult concepts to my students. Besides teaching, I enjoy travelling, learning languages, boxing and biking.
